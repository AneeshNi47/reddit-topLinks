A simple Django and React project to Collect a users subreddits and retrieves the posts with links from it. Once the posts have been retrieved, the application will create a charts to show which Total no. of Domains shared, which domain has been shared the maximum, ( we ignore domains that have less than 10 shares). Due to reddit API limitation we collect Top 500 post from the subreddit.
